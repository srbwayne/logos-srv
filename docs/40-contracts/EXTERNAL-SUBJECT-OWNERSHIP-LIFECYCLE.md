# External Subject Ownership Lifecycle Authority

Status: C1B authority foundation; VERIFY is canonical. This candidate adds
INVALIDATE; other lifecycle mutations remain unimplemented.

## Authority boundary

The HARD-002 operation `SUBJECT_OWNERSHIP_MANAGE` authorizes administration of
external-subject ownership lifecycle state inside one exact namespace. It has
no source dimension. It is administrative authority only and is not proof of
ownership of `(namespace, externalId)`.

The only principal type supported by this foundation is an authenticated,
verified `WORKLOAD` principal with an exact grant for
`SUBJECT_OWNERSHIP_MANAGE` and the target namespace. The stable actor identity
comes from `AuthenticatedPrincipal.principalId` in the trusted server-side
security context. Future ownership history uses `WORKLOAD_OPERATOR` as
`actor_type` and the stable workload principal ID as `actor_id`.

Commands cannot supply actor type or actor ID. Credentials, credential IDs,
emails, display names, and external-subject locators are not audit actor IDs.

## Explicitly separate permissions

```text
PROGRESSION_EXECUTE
!= SUBJECT_PROVISION
!= SUBJECT_OWNERSHIP_MANAGE
```

No existing grant implies ownership-management authority. Namespace/source
authorization does not prove external ownership. AppUser-only authentication,
external self-link, and HARD-001 workload authentication alone do not grant
this authority.

AppUser operators and `SYSTEM` automation are unsupported. No grant, principal,
role, or trust entry is seeded by the authority foundation. No HTTP, message,
scheduled-job, or CLI ingress exists. Lifecycle mutations are limited to the
canonical VERIFY capability and the INVALIDATE capability in this candidate.
C2 execution enforcement and transfer remain outside this foundation.

## VERIFY slice

The initial lifecycle capability accepts only an existing external identity in
`ACTIVE / UNVERIFIED` state. It changes verification to `VERIFIED` and advances
`ownership_version` by one while preserving the locator, target, identity
class, and ownership status. `ACTIVE / VERIFIED` is an idempotent no-op with
no new event or version change. Disabled, revoked, invalidated, native, and
otherwise unsupported identities are rejected.

The command requires an expected ownership version, evidence type (trimmed,
nonblank, at most 64 characters), opaque evidence reference (trimmed,
nonblank, at most 255 characters), and reason (trimmed, nonblank, at most 512
characters). Evidence reference records operator evidence; it does not assert
cryptographic or third-party verification. Effective time is server-derived,
and recorded time is database-derived. The operation authorizes the exact
namespace before disclosing lookup results, locks the current identity row,
and atomically persists the state/version change with one immutable
`OWNERSHIP_VERIFIED` event using `LOGOS_OPERATOR_ACTION` provenance. This
slice adds no HTTP, message, scheduler, or CLI ingress and does not change
resolver or progression execution behavior.

## INVALIDATE slice

This candidate adds only `EXTERNAL / ACTIVE / VERIFIED` to
`EXTERNAL / ACTIVE / INVALIDATED`. It preserves the identity, namespace,
external ID, target, identity class, and ACTIVE ownership status, and advances
`ownership_version` once. Other states, including native identities, are
rejected. An already active invalidated identity is an idempotent no-op,
including when the supplied expected version is stale; evidence inputs are
still validated before the no-op succeeds.

The command requires an expected ownership version and mandatory evidence
type, opaque evidence reference, and reason. They are trimmed, nonblank, and
limited to 64, 255, and 512 characters respectively. The operation uses the
namespace-scoped `SUBJECT_OWNERSHIP_MANAGE` authority and records the trusted
`WORKLOAD_OPERATOR` actor. It writes one immutable
`OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION_INVALIDATED` event with `LOGOS_OPERATOR_ACTION`
provenance. Effective time is server-derived; recorded time is database-
derived. The current-state change and history event are atomic and use the
existing identity-row `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` lock.

Re-verification, disable, reactivate, revoke, transfer, target correction, and
C2 enforcement remain unimplemented. No ingress or resolver/execution behavior
is added by this slice.
